(temp name)

This is a WIP emerald decomp hack I am working on

- Modern gen battle mechanics incl. physical special split
- Modern gen learnsets/stats/move effects/ability effects
- Hard level caps at next gym leader's ace
- EVs disabled
- IVs are viewable in summary screen
- Custom starters
- Fly field move is available from the start of the game for use by any party Pokemon
- All other HMs are usable provided the associated badge has been earned and the HM item is in the bag, no party mon is required to know the move
- HM moves are all forgettable

## Planned features:

- Additional QOL features seen in popular hacks such as portable PC, heal party from menu, infinite candy
- Gym leaders, evil bosses, e4, and many mandatory trainer fights to be revamped and made more difficult
- Sprinkle in some fresh encounters / stat or ability changes
